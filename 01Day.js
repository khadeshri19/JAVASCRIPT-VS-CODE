Hithesh WEB DEVELOPMENT 

Why do we have javascript 

to make the more stronger , interactive web pages eralier but
Now we can make anything 
Interactive WebPages
Mobile Apps
Strong Backend
Desktop apps etc

What is V8 ENgine --> 
Googles Open source high performance Javascript and we assembly engine
written in C++

What is node js 
Free opensource cross origin platform 
Run time enviornment so developer can 
create DEV appps /CLI or tools

How we can execute the javascript files
Before the code runs in run-time
CODE FILE --> PARSING --> SYNTAX TREE

                |
                |
                |

                JIT Compiler

                |
                |
                |
                Byte code--> translate --> machine executable code

                |
                |
                Code executation 



PARSING --> BREAKING AND COLLECTING THE TOKENS FROM THE CODE 
FILE
WHEN THE PARSING HAPPENS THE TOKENIZATION PROCESS GOES ON

SYNTAX TREE = syntactic structure of a program and ignores unnecessary 
details present in a parse tree . Syntax Tree is used a
s the final representation for generating 
machine code or intermediate code.

JIT COMPILER = JUST IN TIME COMPILER
JS does not make all things at once just translate 
the things into the  intermedtiatery
